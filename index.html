        <div class="body">
            <p>The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic meant an extended quarantine, a situation the majority of the current population of the United States has never had to deal with. This new way of life brought many challenges, some seen and others more subtle. One of these more abstract challenged was mental health needs. Many were faced with deteriorating mental health either for the first time or more severely than normal due to the isolation and helplessness prevalent during 2020. Some turned to medicines or counseling, but others were unable to access such resources.</p>
            <p>From August of 2020 through mid-October of 2021, the U.S. Census Bureau received survey data from families across the country as part of the Household Pulse Survey. These internet surveys were meant to track the impacts of the pandemic on each household, and they included data such as employment status, spending, food security, housing, educational disruptions, and mental health status. The data was broken down by responders’ age, race, gender, and sexuality, as well as other dividing factors. Survey answers were submitted after every period of four weeks, allowing collectors to track the data over time as the status of the pandemic changed along with people’s views of the virus.</p>
